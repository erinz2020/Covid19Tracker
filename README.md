Real-time COVID-19 data updates for every country in the world, tracking cases, deaths, recoveries. Leveraged React Hooks and Context to reduce the complexity of state management and allow for greater reusability within and between components. Utilized React, Bootstrap to create a responsive, accessible, and mobile-friendly user interface for the related product components of an Covid-19 Tracker web application. Implemented a D3 data visualization page to show the Covid-19 cases map all over the world. Created filter algorithm that dynamically renders data ranging from sorting criteria search terms, integrating map, search, and filter components.
